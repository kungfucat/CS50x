0.  BMP - 32 bits thus support (256^4) colours=419430400
    GIF - 8 bits thus support (256^1) colours=256
    JPEG- 24 bit thus support (256^3) colours=1638400
    PNG - 24 bit thus support(256^3) colours=1638400
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  lossy means loss of information of the image and if the image is stored exactly(quality of image is  same on 
compression and depression), its called lossless.
3.  JPEG is lossy-compressed.
4.  When a file  is deleted in FAT, meta-data that is pointed to the file, is rewritten whereas the disk block containing
the file's content are still there.
5.  By using a data destruction software, that can overwrite the disk data so many times that it is nearly impossible to
recover data.
8.  BYTE- 1 byte
    DWORD- 4 bytes
    LONG- 4 bytes
    WORD- 2 bytes
9.  In ASCII- BM (stands for bitmap)
    In hexadecimal- 0x42 0x4D
10. bfsize is the size of the bitmap file (in bytes).
    bisize is the size of the strcuture in file (in bytes).
11. When biHeight is negative, bitmap is top-down.(just like in coordinate system as for y=negative, graph lies in 3rd-4th quadrants)
12. biBitCount specifies BMP's color depth.
13. It will return null, when the file is not created (as operating system  may be out of memory) or there was some error.
14. It represents the numbers of triple we read at a time.
15. 3*3=9 bytes. Now we need it to 3 bytes to make it a multiple of 4 and bring it to the next scanline. Thus answer is 3.
16. fseek is used to set the position indicator of the file.
17. It shows the current position of the position indicator of the file.
18. The guy is actually Rick Astley, thanks to David's week 7 lecture video at 23:22.
